World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) Named Entity Recognizer

Erwin Marsi - 2016

Exploratory code to detect and link named entities from World Register of
Marine Species (http://www.marinespecies.org/) in raw text.

Requires an export of teh tu_matrix database in CVS format with fields
AphiaID, RankName and ScientificName.

This is very much experimental and certainly not fit for production.
